        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>With that data, can you answer the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"</p>
