## Unit 4.1 - Introduction to Pandas & Jupyter

### Overview

Today's lesson will introduce students to Jupyter Notebook and the basics of the Pandas module.

### Class Objectives

* Students will be able to serve Jupyter notebook files from local directories and connect to their development environment
* Students will be able to create Pandas DataFrames from scratch
* Students will understand how to run functions on Pandas DataFrames
* Students will know how to read/write DataFrames from/to CSV files using Pandas

### Activities Preview

* **Netflix Remix**

* Files/Instructions:

  ![Netflix Remix Output](Images/02-NetflixRemix_Outputs.png)

  * For this activity, students will be creating a Jupyter Notebook that performs the same functions as the Netflix activity from last week.

  * [Netflix.py](Activities/02-Stu_NetflixRemix/Unsolved/Netflix.py)

  * [Netflix_Ratings.csv](Activities/02-Stu_NetflixRemix/Unsolved/Resources/netflix_ratings.csv)

  * Using `Netflix.py` as a jumping off point, convert the application so that it runs properly within a Jupyter Notebook.

  * Make sure to have the application print out the user's input, the path to `Netflix_Ratings.csv`, and the final rating/review for the film in different cells.

  * Bonus: Go through any of the activities from last week and attempt to convert them to run within a Jupyter Notebook. While doing this, try to split up the code into cells and print out the outputs.

  * Hints: If your development environment does not appear as a potential kernel within Jupyter Notebook, close out of Jupyter Notebook and run `conda install -c anaconda nb_conda_kernels` within the terminal. Upon reloading Jupyter Notebook, all possible kernels should now appear.

* **Data-Frame Shop**

* Files/Instructions:

  ![DataFrame Shop Code](Images/04-DataFrameShop_Output.png)

  * [04-Stu_DataFrameShop](Activities/04-Stu_DataFrameShop/Unsolved/DataFrameShop.ipynb)

  * Create a DataFrame for a frame shop that contains three columns - "Frame", "Price", and "Sales" - and has five rows of data stored within it.

  * Using an alternate method from that used before, create a DataFrame for an art gallery that contains three columns - "Painting", "Price", and "Popularity" - and has four rows of data stored within it.

  * Bonus: Once both of the DataFrames have been created, discuss with those around you which method you prefer to use and why.

* **Training Grounds**

* File/Instructions:

  ![Training Grounds Starter](Images/06-TrainingGrounds_Start.png)

  * [TrainingGrounds.ipynb](Activities/06-Stu_TrainingGrounds/Unsolved/TrainingGrounds.ipynb)

  * Using the DataFrame provided, perform all of the following actions...

  * Provide a simple, analytical overview of the dataset's numeric columns

  * Collect all of the names of the trainers within the dataset

  * Figure out how many students each trainer has

  * Find the average weight of the students at the gym

  * Find the combined weight of all of the students at the gym

  * Convert the "Membership (Days)" column into weeks and then add this new series into the DataFrame

* **Hey Arnold!**

* Files/Instructions:

  ![Hey Arnold Starter](Images/08-HeyArnold_Starter.png)

  * [hey_arnold.ipynb](Activities/08-Stu_Hey_Arnold/Unsolved/hey_arnold.ipynb)

  * First, use Pandas to create a DataFrame with the following columns and values:

    * `Character_in_show`: Arnold, Gerald, Helga, Phoebe, Harold, Eugene

    * `color_of_hair`: blonde, black, blonde, black, unknown, red

    * `Height`: average, tallish, tallish, short, tall, short

    * `Football_Shaped_Head`: True, False, False, False, False, False

  * You'll note that the above column names are inconsistent and difficult to work with. Rename them to the following, respectively:

    * `Character`, `Hair Color`, `Height`, `Football Head`

  * Next, create a new table that contains all of the columns in the following order...

    * `Character`, `Football Head`, `Hair Color`, `Height`

* **GoodReads**

* Files/Instructions:

  ![GoodReads Output](Images/10-GoodReads_Output.png)

  ![GoodReads Summary Output](Images/11-GoodReads_Summary.png)

  * [GoodReads.ipynb](Activities/10-Stu_GoodReads/Unsolved/GoodReads.ipynb)

  * [books.csv](Activities/10-Stu_GoodReads/Unsolved/Resources/books.csv)

  * [GoodReadsSummary.ipynb](Activities/11-Stu_GoodReadsSummary/Unsolved/GoodReadsSummary.ipynb)

  * [books_clean.csv](Activities/11-Stu_GoodReadsSummary/Unsolved/Resources/books_clean.csv)

  * Read in the GoodReads CSV using Pandas

  * Remove unnecessary columns from the DataFrame so that only the following columns remain: `isbn`, `original_publication_year`, `original_title`, `authors`, `ratings_1`, `ratings_2`, `ratings_3`, `ratings_4`, and `ratings_5`

  * Rename the columns to the following: `ISBN`, `Publication Year`, `Original Title`, `Authors`, `One Star Reviews`, `Two Star Reviews`, `Three Star Reviews`, `Four Star Reviews`, and `Five Star Reviews`

  * Write the DataFrame into a new CSV file

  * Using the modified DataFrame that was created earlier, create a summary table for the dataset that includes the following pieces of information...

  * The count of unique authors within the DataFrame

  * The year of the earliest published book in the DataFrame

  * The year of the latest published book in the DataFrame

  * The total number of reviews within the DataFrame

  * Hints: The base CSV file uses UTF-8 encoding. Trying to read in the file using some other kind of encoding could lead to strange characters appearing within the dataset.
