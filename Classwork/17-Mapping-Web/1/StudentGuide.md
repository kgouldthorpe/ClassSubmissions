## Unit 17.1: Data Visualization with Leaflet

### Overview

Today's lesson will be spent introducing students to data visualization with maps. Students will gain a basic understanding of the Leaflet.js mapping library before diving headfirst into a number of increasingly involved examples.

### Class Objectives

* Students will understand the benefits that visualizing data with maps can provide.

* Students will learn the basics of creating maps and plotting data with the Leaflet.js library.

* Students will gain an understanding of the GeoJSON format.
