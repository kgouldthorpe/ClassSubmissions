### Overview

Today's lesson dives into scraping websites with the Beautiful Soup library for Python. Students will start out scraping simple HTML strings before moving onto live web pages.

### Class Objectives

* Students will be able to use Beautiful Soup to scrape their own data from the web.

* Students will learn to save the results of web scraping into MongoDB.

### Activities Preview

* **CNN Soup**
* Files/Instructions:

  * [Stu_CNN-Unsolved.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_CNNSoup/Unsolved/Stu_CNN-Unsolved.ipynb)

  * Believe it or not, CNN's website for [1996: Year in Review](http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/) is still alive on the web! We have, however, stored the HTML document as a string in your starter file.

  * Your task, should you accept it (and you should), is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape and print the following pieces of information:

    1. The title of the webpage

    2. All paragraph texts on the page

    3. The top 10 headlines for the year. This last one is a bit tricky and may not come out perfectly!

  * **Hint**: For the third task in this activity you will need a means of filtering the data... Perhaps over multiple iterations... With a loop... HINT HINT!

  * **Bonus**: If you finish early, head over to the [Beautful Soup documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to read up on accessing attributes and navigating the DOM.

* **Reddit Scraper**
* Instructions:

  * In this activity, you will scrape the [Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) using Beautiful Soup. 
  
  * Scrape only threads that have twenty or more comments and then print the thread's title, number of comments, as well as the URL for the thread.

* **Hockey Headers**
* Instructions:

  * Teamwork! Speed! Mental and physical toughness! Passion! Excitement! Unpredictable matchups down to the wire! What could be better? While these terms could easily be applied to a data science hackathon, we're talking about the magnificent sport of hockey.

  * Your assignment is to scrape the articles on the front page of the [NHL website](https://www.nhl.com/) - which is frequently updated - and then post the results of your scraping to MongoDB.

  * Use Beautiful Soup and requests to scrape the title and heading of each article on the front page.

  * Post the above information as a MongoDB document and then print all of the documents on the database to the console.

  * In addition to the above, post the time and date of the article publication as well.

* **Bookscraper**
* Instructions:

  * [README.md](Activities/08-Stu_Splinter/README.md)

* **Doctor Decoder**
* Files/Instructions:

  * [Stu_Doctor_Decoder.ipynb](Activities/10-Stu_Doctor_Decoder/Unsolved/Stu_Doctor_Decoder.ipynb)

  * [README](Activities/10-Stu_Doctor_Decoder/README.md)
