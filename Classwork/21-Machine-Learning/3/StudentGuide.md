## Unit 21.3 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning!

### Overview

Today's lesson provides students with an introduction to neural nets and deep learning using Keras.

### Class Objectives

* Students will be able to articulate specific problems on which neural networks perform well.

* Students will be able to use Keras to build and train neural networks.

* Students will be able to use Keras to build and a train a deep neural network.

* Students will understand unsupervised learning and how to apply the Kmeans algorithm.

### Activities Preview

* **Moons**
* Files/Instructions:

  * [04-Stu_Moons/Moons.ipynb](Activities/04-Stu_Moons/Unsolved/Moons.ipynb)
  
  * [04-Stu_Moons/README.md](Activities/04-Stu_Moons/README.md)

  * Create a Neural Network and Deep Neural Network Classifier that correctly classifies both moons from the dataset.

  * Train both models using 100 training epochs.

  * Compare the accuracy of both models.

  * Bonus: Try to find the minimal architecture (number of nodes) and minimum training iterations required to achieve a score of at least .90.

* **Deep Voice**
* Files/Instructions:

  * [05-Stu_Voice_Recognition.ipynb](Activities/05-Stu_Deep_Voice/Unsolved/Voice_Recognition.ipynb)

  * [05-Stu_Deep_Voice/voice.csv](Activities/05-Stu_Deep_Voice/Resources/voice.csv)

  * [05-Stu_Deep_Voice/voice.md](Activities/05-Stu_Deep_Voice/Resources/voice.md)

  * [05-Stu_Deep_Voice/README.md](Activities/05-Stu_Deep_Voice/README.md)

  * Create a deep learning model with 2 hidden layers.  Each layer should have 100 nodes.

  * Compile and fit the model.

  * Quantify (score) the model.

  * Use the first 5 testing data points to make predictions.  Then, compare the predictions to the actual labels.

* **Predicting Human Activity from Smartphone Accelerometer Data**
* Files/Instructions:

  * [07-Stu_Smartphone/Smartphone_Activity_Detector.ipynb](Activities/07-Stu_Smartphone/Unsolved/Smartphone_Activity_Detector.ipynb)

  * [07-Stu_Smartphone/X_train.txt](Activities/07-Stu_Smartphone/Resources/Train/X_train.txt)

  * [07-Stu_Smartphone/y_train.txt](Activities/07-Stu_Smartphone/Resources/Train/y_train.txt)

  * [07-Stu_Smartphone/X_test.txt](Activities/07-Stu_Smartphone/Resources/Test/X_test.txt)

  * [07-Stu_Smartphone/y_test.txt](Activities/07-Stu_Smartphone/Resources/Test/y_test.txt)

  * [07-Stu_Smartphone/README.txt](Activities/07-Stu_Smartphone/README.md)

  * Follow the comments in the provided starter file to:

    * Encode necessary labels.

    * Build and train a deep learning model.

    * Save the model.

    * Load to model.

    * Use the loaded model to predict the activity of a smartphone user based one data point from the test set.

* **KMeans**
* File/Instructions:

  * [09-Stu_Kmeans/Kmeans.ipynb](Activities/09-Stu_Kmeans/Unsolved/Kmeans.ipynb)

  * [09-Stu_Kmeans/README.md](Activities/09-Stu_Kmeans/README.md)

  * Use the starter code to fit a Kmeans model to a dataset.

  * Visualize the results by creating a plot that looks like the following.

    ![Stu_Kmeans_plot](Images/Stu_Kmeans_plot.png)

  * Bonus: Look up how to get the centers of the Kmeans clusters and plot them!
