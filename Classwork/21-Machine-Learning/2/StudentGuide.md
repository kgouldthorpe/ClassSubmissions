## Unit 21.2 - Classification

### Overview

Today's lesson plan introduces students to classification algorithms in Scikit-learn.

### Class Objectives

* Students will understand how to calculate and apply the fundamental classification algorithms: logistic regression, SVM, KNN, decision trees, and random forests.

* Students will understand how to quantify and validate classification models including calculating a classification report.

* Students will understand how to apply `GridSearchCV` to hyper tune model parameters.
