## Unit 9.1: Introduction to SQL

### Overview

In today's class, students will be introduced to SQL databases and will learn how to create tables and simple queries.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

- Install and run Postgres and pgAdmin on their computers.
- Create a database and tables using pgAdmin.
- Define SQL data types, primary keys, and unique values.
- Load CSV files into a database and query the data.
- Articulate the four basic functions of persistent storage (CRUD) and apply this set of functions to a database.
- Combine data from multiple tables using JOINs.

### Activities Preview

* **Create a Database**

* Instructions:

  * Open pgAdmin in a new browser window, ensure that you can view your new server in the browser.

  * Here are the steps to create a database using pgAdmin.

    * In the pgAdmin editor, right-click the newly established server to create a new database.

    * From the menu, select **Create**, and then select **Database** to create a new database.

    * Enter **animals_db** as the database name. Make sure the owner is set as the default postgres, and then click **Save**.

  * At this point, there should be a new database listed in the left-hand menu. The new database, `animals_db`, is not yet connected to the server. Simply clicking on the database will create a connection to Postgres.
