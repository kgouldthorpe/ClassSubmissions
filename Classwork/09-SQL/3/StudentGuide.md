## Unit 9.3: Data Modeling

### Overview

Today's class will focus on data modeling and best practices for designing a database. Students will learn how to normalize data and how tables in a database are related, as well as how to create visualizations of databases using entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

* Apply data modeling techniques to database design.
* Normalize data.
* Identify data relationships.
* Create visual representations of a database through entity relationship diagrams.
