## Unit 1.3 - Charting a New Course With Excel

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to both basic and advanced charting in Excel, teaching them everything they need to know to make data visualizations.

### Class Objectives

* Students will be able to make, modify, and style bar charts, line graphs, pie graphs, and scatter plots.
* Students will understand how to filter data using Excel.
* Students will know how to calculate moving averages and regressions.

### Activities Preview

* **Adding files to Github**

* We'll go over how to submit a homework assignment in Github. "GitHub offers a centralized location where all developers can push and pull (upload and download) their code. This means that GitHub always holds the most up-to-date code and files, handling everyone's updates appropriately. For now, students will only need to know how to use the GUI for GitHub in order to submit homework. However, In a couple of weeks, students will learn to work with Github through the terminal using git.

* **The Line and Bar Grades**

* For this activity, students are going to take upon themselves the role of a teacher as they create a series of bar and line graphs that visualize the grades of their class over the course of a semester.

* **Video Game Sales**

* Looking into a product's sales within a region and comparing it to that product's sales worldwide is a great way to determine how important a region is to a company. In this activity, students will pair up in order to create a series of scatter plots which will compare video game sales across regions.

* **Filter Game Sales**

* Now that we know how to apply filters to a spreadsheet and create charts based on filtered data sets, lets take some time to create charts which compare the sales of publishers against one another.

* **Golfing Targets**

* What better way to express moving averages than with a data set that is all about calculating the average accuracy of a golfer? We had 5 golfers take 20 shots onto a green and calculated the distance to the hole. It is up to our students to find the moving averages of their shots using different intervals.

* **Regression Activity**

* Let's use our newly learned regression skills to take a look at the 2017 NBA season.

  * Files/Instructions:
