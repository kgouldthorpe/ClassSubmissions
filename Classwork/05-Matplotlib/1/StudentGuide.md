## Unit 5.1 - Introduction to Matplotlib

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the basics of [Matplotlib](http://Matplotlib.org/), one of the most popular Python plotting libraries in use today.

### Class Objectives

* Students should understand Matplotlib's pyplot interface.

* Students should be able to create line, bar, scatter, and pie charts.

* Students should be able to change the appearance of their plots.

### Activities Preview

* **New Jersey Weather**

* Instructions:

  * Using the following data, plot the monthly averages for temperature in New Jersey.

    * Use the numeric value for months.

    * Average temperature per month in Fahrenheit: `[39, 42, 51, 62, 72, 82, 86, 84, 77, 65, 55, 44]`

  * Use list comprehension to convert the temperature to Celsius and plot that line as well.

  * Create a third plot that includes both lines.

  * Hints:

    * The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: `(x-32) * 0.56`

    * See the [MatPlotLib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) for more information regarding the PyPlot library

    * Also look into the [NumPy Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) for more information on the NumPy library

* **Legendary Temperature**

* Files/Instructions:

  * [02-Stu_NJTemp/nj_temp.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_NJTemp/Solved/NJ_temp.ipynb)

  * [avg_temp.png](Activities/04-Stu_LegendaryTemperature/Images/avg_temp.png)

  * Modify the New Jersey temperature line charts from earlier so that they match the image provided.

  * Once the plot has been created, look through the [MatPlotLib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) to see what additional formatting could be added to the chart.

* **Coaster Speed**

* Files/Instructions:

  * [Coaster Speed Chart](Activities/06-Stu_RollerCoaster/Images/CoasterSpeed.png)

  * Create a line chart with two plots using the following data:

    * `Danger Drop: [9, 8, 90, 85, 80, 70, 70, 65, 55, 60, 70, 65, 50]`

    * `RailGun: [75, 70, 60, 65, 60, 45, 55, 50, 40, 40, 35, 35, 30]`

  * Both coasters are 120 seconds long and the speed was measured every 10 seconds.

  * Apply styling and labels that match the image provided.

* **Bars Bar Chart**

* Files/Instructions:

  * [08-Stu_PyBars/py_bars.ipynb](Activities/08-Stu_PyBars/Unsolved/py_bars.ipynb)

  * [Bars Bar Chart](Activities/08-Stu_PyBars/Images/BarDensity.png)

  * Using the file provided as a starter, create a bar chart that matches the image provided.

* **Pies Pie Chart**

* Files/Instructions:

  * [10-Stu_PyPies/py_pie.ipynb](Activities/10-Stu_PyPies/Unsolved/py_pie.ipynb)

  * [Pies Pie Chart](Activities/10-Stu_PyPies/Images/PyPies.png)

  * Using the file provided as a starter, create a pie chart that matches the image provided.

* **Scatter Py**

* Files/Instructions:

  * [12-Stu_ScatterPy/ice_cream_sales.ipynb](Activities/12-Stu_ScatterPy/Unsolved/ice_cream_sales.ipynb)

  * [IceCreamSales Chart](Activities/12-Stu_ScatterPy/Images/IceCreamSales.png)

  * Using the file provided as a starter, create a scatter plot that matches the image provided.

  * Bonus: Create a new list called "scoop_price," fill it with values, and then set it so that the size of the dots are set according to those values.

* **Average Rainfall**

* Files/Instructions:

  * [avg_rain_state.csv](Activities/13-Stu_AvgRain/Resources/avg_rain_state.csv)

  * [avg_state_rain.ipynb](Activities/13-Stu_AvgRain/Unsolved/avg_state_rain.ipynb)

  * [avg_state_rain.png](Activities/13-Stu_AvgRain/Images/avg_state_rain.png)

  * Using the resources provided, create a bar graph that matches that of the image provided.
